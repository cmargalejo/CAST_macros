In this directory, the python scripts used to compute the limit on the axion-photon coupling
from the CAST 2019-2021 data are kept.

It is currently in a very preliminary state. However the current state is a good working example.

**TODOs**:
* The different datasets (Ar1, Ar2 and Xe) still have to be handled separately. A different likelihood has to be computed for each, meaning that the background rate and efficiency used in each case should be different. At the end, multiply the three of the likelihoods to obtain the combined result.

* An unbinned approach still has to be implemented.
