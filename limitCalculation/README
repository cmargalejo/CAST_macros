In this directory, the python scripts used to compute the limit on the axion-photon coupling
from the CAST 2019-2021 data are kept.

It is currently in a very preliminary state, as the different datasets (Ar1, Ar2 and Xe) still have
to be handled separately. A different likelihood has to be computed for each and then multiply the
three of them.

However the current state is a good working example.

An unbinned approach still has to be implemented.
