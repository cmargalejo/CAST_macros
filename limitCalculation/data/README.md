This directory stores data that have to be used for the limit calculation.

* The gases and window efficiencies are computed using data from henke.lbl.gov.
* The LLNL telesopce efficiency is extracted from the thesis X-ray optics in new instruments for astro- and astroparticle physics, by A.C.Jakobsen (https://backend.orbit.dtu.dk/ws/portalfiles/portal/122353510/phdthesis_for_DTU_orbit.pdf)
* The cluster candidates energies and x, y position are extracted from the final ROOT file with all the candidates after cuts. For now these candidates are not separated by datasets.
