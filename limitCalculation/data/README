This directory stores data that have to be used for the limit calculation.

* The gases and window efficiencies are computed using data from henke.lbl.gov.
* The LLNL telesopce efficiency is extracted from the thesis X-ray optics in new instruments for astro- and astroparticle physics Jakobsen, by Anders Clemen
* The cluster candidates energies and x, y posision are extracted from the final ROOT file with all the candidates after cuts.
